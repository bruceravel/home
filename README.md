=======================

I am a physicist in the
[Synchrotron Science Group](http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/synchrotron-science/index.cfm)
in the
[Materials Measurement Division](http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/index.cfm)
of the [Materials Measurement Laboratory](http://www.nist.gov/mml/) at
[The National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov/)
My group is stationed at
[Brookhaven National Laboratory](http://www.bnl.gov).  I am the local
contact of [Beamline X23A2](http://xafs.org/Community/X23A2), an XAFS
