I am a physicist in the [[http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/synchrotron-science/index.cfm][Synchrotron Science Group]] in the [[http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/index.cfm][Materials
Measurement Division]] of the [[http://www.nist.gov/mml/][Materials Measurement Laboratory]] at [[http://www.nist.gov/][The
National Institute of Standards and Technology]].  My group is stationed
at [[http://www.bnl.gov][Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. I am the local contact of [[http://xafs.org/Community/X23A2][Beamline
X23A2]], an XAFS beamline at the [[http://www.bnl.gov/ps/][National Synchrotron Light Source]].

I participate only to a limited extent in modern "social media". I
silently ignore contact requests involving Facebook, LinkedIn, and
most other such websites.
